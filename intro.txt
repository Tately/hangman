Try to guess the hidden word one letter at a   
time. The number of dashes are equivalent to   
the number of letters in the word. If a player 
suggests a letter that occurs in the word,     
blank places containing this character will be 
filled with that letter. If the word does not  
contain the suggested letter, one new element  
of a hangmanâ€™s gallow is painted. As the game  
progresses, a segment of a victim is added for 
every suggested letter not in the word. Goal is
to guess the word before the man hangs!
